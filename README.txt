Villager's Nose
-------------------------------------------
Villager's Nose is a small, joke mod where players can cut off villagers' noses. It requires Forge to run.

This mod is a slightly-tweaked update of StarSheep's original Villager's Nose mod, which runs on Minecraft 1.7.
The original version can be found here: curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/villagers-nose


Features
==============================
- Right-click on a villager with shears to remove their nose and drop it as an item
   - A villager without a nose will eventually regrow one, unless disabled in the configuration
   - The time to regrow a villager's nose can also be set in the configuration
- Equip a villager's nose to the player's head slot to detect nearby emerald ore
   - When near emerald ore, the nose will wiggle and play villager sounds
   - The emerald ore search range can be set in the configuration
- Plant a villager's nose in hoed soil (farmland) to grow a villager
